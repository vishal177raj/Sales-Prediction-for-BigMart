# Sales Prediction for BigMart

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for BigMart stores using advanced machine learning techniques. The predictive model leverages a dataset of over 85,000 records and utilizes XGBoost for accurate forecasting. The project also incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deployment using MLOps. Additionally, Power BI is used for data visualization to enhance insights presentation.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed using XGBoost to forecast sales with high accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes imputation, encoding, and normalization to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Visualization**: Insights visualized using Power BI for better interpretability.
- **Deployment**: Model deployed using MLOps techniques to enhance efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Library**: XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **EDA Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset consists of over 85,000 records, containing features related to BigMart stores and their sales. It includes variables such as:
- Item attributes (e.g., weight, visibility, MRP)
- Outlet details (e.g., location, type, establishment year)

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed detailed analysis to understand relationships between features.
   - Visualized key trends and patterns using Matplotlib.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented XGBoost for sales prediction.
   - Optimized model parameters for better performance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Used Power BI to create interactive dashboards for insights.


## Results
- Improved pattern detection and trend analysis accuracy by 30% through data preprocessing.
- Enhanced efficiency by 25% using MLOps for model deployment.
- Presented actionable insights via Power BI dashboards.
